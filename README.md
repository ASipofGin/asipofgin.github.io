Nothing to see here.

Or is there?

Yes there is because I want my 1pt :>

This website is a quick demo setup to demonstrate my HTML, CSS, and JS abilities.

The landing page contains a JS animation that swaps out the text in the title with my name in the 3 languages I speak.

You can use the nav bar to jump to the different sections as well as the visualization page.

The index.html document uses clear html structure as well as most html elements such as H1, p, a, nav, div.

The index.html page is contrains all the basic information about me such as work history, eductation, as well as ways to contact me.

On the visualizations page, first there is a SVG created by hand and along with js scripts it shows individual values for amount spent on videogames related stuff, on the bottom is a Mondrian esque artwork created with help from  https://generativeartistry.com/tutorials/piet-mondrian/

Sticky navigation is included so the menu remains accessible as you scroll.

Smooth scrolling and internal anchor links improve the user experience.

The project structure is as required.

To view the website, open the index.html file in any modern browser or visit asipofgin.github.io (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

This project demonstrates not only technical skills but also design awareness, blending personal info with generative visual art.
